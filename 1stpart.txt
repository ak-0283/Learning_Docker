while creating a docker file

1. first write the base image
e.g -> FROM python:3.9

2. write the workdirectory
e.g -> WORKDIR /app

3. copy the directory
e.g -> COPY . (Destination path) /app(where we want to copy)
means to write -> COPY . /app


4. run the docker 
e.g -> RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

5. give the port where you want to run
e.g -> EXPOSE 8000

6. command to execute the file
e.g -> CMD["python","run","./app.py"(main directory)]
